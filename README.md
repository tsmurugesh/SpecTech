## Overview
The speculative  technology I am proposing is an automatic art generator, mainly used for generating new pieces for museums and educational exhibits. Art today is seen almost as a commodity–non creatives expect art and media at a rapid pace and at a reasonable price, this results in creators having to feel that they have to rush to create content, leading to burn out. Often in museums (especially Modern Art museums people remark that “Anyone could make something as simple as this”-so what if they could.  If art could be created continuously/instantaneously  with no thought behind it, would people still enjoy it all the same? How does that affect the message it provides?

In this interactive experience the user views the opinion of 3 artists, a CEO, and 2 museum goers, and what they all think about this new technology.


## Technicals


The project was to make an interactive experience surrounding a new technology of choice that would affect multiple different communities. It is essentially a series of states rooms that you navigate through via clickables, key presses, and mouse clicks. Depending on  choices you make, your score will increase or stay the same, and the number will help determine what ending you get.

The game utilizes clickableMangers and adventureStatesManager to help manage organization.
